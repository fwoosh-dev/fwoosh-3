  - [ ] this one is interesting cause the panel need to be able to analyze the iframe contents
  - [ ] this will probably need the data layer. the layer needs to work with the iframe and will probably use local storage (TinyBase)

- [ ] document... everything

- [ ] testing library built on playwright
